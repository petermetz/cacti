# Join us!

Hyperledger Cactus was designed to be highly modular from day one and therefore joining us not just individually but also as a whole team or project is very much in the realm of possibilities.

> The Hyperledger Cactus maintainers would love to have other projects who use our connectors (and then contribute to them as well ;-))

This would lower the amount of duplicate work that's being done throughout the different Hyperledger (and non-Hyperledger) projects while also resulting in higher quality connectors at the same time (more eyes/more hands on deck/etc.).

In addition to the connectors, which are mostly just plumbing, there's the topic of higher level constructs such as interoperability protocols and their implementations:

We also welcome everyone to come and join us with these, where multiple different interop. protocol implementations can co-exist under Cactus by the power of the plugin architecture.

We stress that last part because we want to avoid people thinking that joining us would mean throwing out their babies with the bathwater.

To further protect said proverbial babies, we could explore a refined governance model where we grant maintainer rights on specific packages within the mono-repo that Cactus is, so that joining us would not mean giving away control over one's code.
