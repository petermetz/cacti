# `@hyperledger/cacti-plugin-ledger-connector-celo`

This plugin provides `Cacti` a way to interact with Celo networks. Using this we can perform:
* Deploy Smart-contracts through bytecode.
* Build and sign transactions using different keystores.
* Invoke smart-contract functions that we have deployed on the network.
